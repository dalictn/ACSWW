Automated Covid Stats With WhatsApp

Experimented with trying to have Covid stats sent to a list of recipients, but ultimately the project failed because there is no whatsapp API, and all the unofficial ones with the broadcast feature need to be paid for, Credits to Anirudh Bagri for the whatsapp Code










Thank you for checking out this repo, its unfortunate that it turned out like this, I may revive the project in the future when I have a budget for it
